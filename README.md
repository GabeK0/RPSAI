Rock Paper Scissors AI

Very light, but effective, rock paper scissors AI written in C++. It is built to recognize patterns in human play, and will generally start to win most games against a given player after it has played 50+ rounds against them. Also, your play history will be saved in a .txt file so that you may play again without the AI having to relearn your play style.
